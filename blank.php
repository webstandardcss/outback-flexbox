    <h1>Welcome to Outback!</h1>
    <p>It all began in 1981 with Rick Meritt building custom steel fences and buildings as 3-M Steel Construction. Named 3-M (three Meritts) to include his wife and son.</p>
	  <p>As he built all over Texas, Rick developed products that better suited his first love – Hunting. Hence, Outback Wildlife Feeders was created and began with a single deer feeder. The product line has expanded to include about four dozen hunting, fishing and ranch equipment items.</p>
  	<p>Outback products are “Built Right the First Time, to Last a Lifetime”, withstanding extreme weather, wind and wildlife abuse.</p>
  	<p>All Outback products are innovatively designed and built at the original location in Gilmer, Texas. Made with only high quality American steel and craftsmanship, all products are 100% Satisfaction Guaranteed.</p>
